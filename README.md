Week 2 assignment - Image gallery

## Reflection

Please also provide an assignment reflection in your project README.md file.

# Required

What requirements did you achieve?

1/4 - my site is responsive; I believe there is a clear difference between mobile and desktop view
2/4 - there are media queries for screens under 600px
3/4 - I have included alt text for all images

Were there any requirements or goals that you were unable to achieve?

4/4 - Sadly, I was unable to get the JS working to make the buttons work; functions & events seem to be an area of deficit in my learning

If so, what was it that you found difficult about these tasks?
This assignment has been one of the most difficult things I have done in recent time because of the sheer amout of theoretical knowledge that needed to be assimilated in making the website. It also feels like a huge jump from 'no coding experience' to 'splash page' to 'image gallery'. I felt very inept and found it a highly frustrating assignment.

# Optional

Feel free to add any other reflections you would like to share about your submission, for example:

Requesting feedback about a specific part of your submission.

- Kindly give clarity on where I went off the rails and up the wazoo with my JS code - I think I am on the right track but some elements are amiss.

- Also, is my CSS up to scratch or have it just cobbled together something that doesn't really hold up?
  I'd like to think I have a decent grasp of HTML and CSS now - perhaps I am overestimating my proficiency..

What useful external sources helped you complete the assignment (e.g Youtube tutorials)?

- ChatGPT to explain the DOM; YouTube; GeeksforGeeks; CssTricks; and the learning material of course. Old demo code has been instrumental and doing the workshops helped me recall some of my own code that has proven helpful.

What errors or bugs did you encounter while completing your assignment? How did you solve them?

- (Ha! Haha! Hah!)Where do I start; I could not get the thumbnail container to be centered and hold all images in an organised fashion without overflowing - nor get the full size image to display edge to edge of the viewport - I had to optimise my image bc my loadtimes were abysmal - I could not get the button to work - I encountered errors left and right due to syntax - forgot parameter in certain functions - I could go on.

What went really well and what could have gone better?
I got my Github repository set up much more smoothly than last week - I was able to recreate my steps without much hassle and submitted my links on Friday which took some stress off my plate. I took MANY break b/c they were much needed for the avoidance of overheating my grey matter. Use of the dev tools e.g. network, console, lighthouse have been stellar. My handling of functions and events could really have made a difference in performance on this coding exercise so I am a bit salty about that.

I also really wanted a picture to be dislay on load but could not get this to work - though not part of the assignment, it certainly generated cosmic-level frustration.
I probably just need to do more learning around that to get it under the belt.

I think overall the most diffcult thing has been the learning curve - it has been steep and challenging, as expected but nevertheless exhausting.
I am fairly happy with the site I produced; I think it is aesthetically pleasing and fit-for-purpose; I am just missing some functionality.

Thank you Manny & Bartie on all the breakout session assistance :) Onwards & upwards!
